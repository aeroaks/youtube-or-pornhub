# youtube-or-pornhub

**Zeno** is a tool that, by analyzing the traffic of a given network, can detect what service is being used. It can detect if the user is browsing, listening to Spotify (or both), watching a Youtube video... and even differentiate it from a Pornhub video!

The analysis of the traffic is non-intrusive, so this will work even on ciphered traffic.
